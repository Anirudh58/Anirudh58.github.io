## Object Following Quadcopter
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jDHYdiEp-eQ?color=white&theme=light"></iframe>
For Alex's final year undergraduate research project at Auckland University he developed an autonomous object following control system on a quadcopter using on-board, monocular vision. The quadcopter was able to track objects using computer vision processed on-board the quadcopter. The object's x, y coordinate and scale from the on-board video is used to regulate the yaw, height and range respectively. He published this work at the [IEEE conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems 2014](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Karl_Stol/publication/270511150_On-board_object_tracking_control_of_a_quadcopter_with_monocular_vision/links/54ac79430cf21c47713a00c5.pdf).

Alex created custom Augmented Reality software to convey design information to clients while working as an engineering consultant at Beca. It was a standalone hardware system using Microsoft Kinect 2.0 and the Unity framework which was able to be deployed for a range of applications.

## Firefighting Robot

This was a final year design project in the University of Auckland Mechatronics course. Our team's solution was a robot which could autonomously path plan and localise flames (candles), extinguishing them with a CO2 system. The robot was designed and constructed with 3D printing technology. More information is available on [the project page](http://homepages.engineering.auckland.ac.nz/~pxu012/mechatronics2013/group2/home.html).
