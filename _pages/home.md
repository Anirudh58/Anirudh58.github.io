## Home

<small> Hey! I am currently pursuing my MS in Computer Science at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/), where I will be specializing in Computational Perception and Robotics. I am also a Graduate Teaching Assistant here. Prior to starting my Masters, I have worked in Machine Learning roles at [Iron Mountain Insight](https://www.ironmountain.com/services/content-service-platform) and [Samsung Research Institute Bangalore](https://research.samsung.com/sri-b). I completed my Bachelors in [Computer Science at NIT-Trichy](https://www.nitt.edu/home/academics/departments/cse/). Please head over to my [resume](/resume) or [projects](/projects) to know more about my work experiences.

## Interests

<small> I love Mathematics and solving challenging problem statements or puzzles. I always hope and strive to write clean, well-documented code. During my 3 years of industry experience, I have worked with a good mix of Machine Learning, Systems, Cloud and IoT. In the next few years of my career, I want to explore and learn more along similar domains, building solutions that bridge research and industry.  </small>

<small> Work apart, I passionately follow and play Football/Cricket. I try to practice yoga regularly and truly believe being active and fit is essential for a well-functioning mind. </small>

## Get in touch

<small> If you're taking up CS4400 - Intro to Database Systems, and you wish to contact me for queries (pun intended), you can find details of my office hours on Piazza. For everything else, please feel free to shoot an email! </small>
