## About

<small> I am a CS Graduate Student, specializing in Machine Learning at [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/). I am also a Graduate Teaching Assistant here for Machine Learning (CS 7641). I have coupled my Masters program with a research project [Exploratory Video Analytics](https://evadb.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), advised by [Prof. Joy Arulraj](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~jarulraj/), where we are trying to build a Visual Database Management System that enables easy and efficient querying over videos. </small>

<small> This summer I interned at [Meta](https://meta.com) in the Creation ML team, where I had the opportunity to work end-to-end on ML pipelines, building and training large scale models for Music Recommendation used across Facebook for Stories and Reels. Prior to starting my Masters, I have worked in Machine Learning roles at [Iron Mountain Insight](https://www.ironmountain.com/services/content-service-platform) and [Samsung Research Institute Bangalore](https://research.samsung.com/sri-b). I graduated from [NIT-Trichy](https://www.nitt.edu/home/academics/departments/cse/) in 2018, where I received my B.Tech. in Computer Science and Engineering. Please head over to my [resume](/resume) or [projects](/projects) to know more about my work experiences. </small>

## Interests

<small> I love Mathematics and solving challenging problem statements or puzzles. I always hope and strive to write clean, well-documented code. In the past 4 years of my academic and industry experience, I have worked with a good mix of Machine Learning, Systems and Cloud. In the next few years of my career, I want to explore and learn more along similar domains, building solutions that bridge research and industry.  </small>

<small> Work apart, I passionately follow and play Football/Cricket. I try to practice yoga regularly and truly believe being active and fit is essential for a well-functioning mind. </small>
