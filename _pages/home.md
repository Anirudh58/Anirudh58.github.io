## About

<small> Hello! I am a CS Graduate Student, specializing in Machine Learning at [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/). Coursework apart, I am working on a project [Exploratory Video Analytics](https://evagatech.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), advised by [Prof. Joy Arulraj](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~jarulraj/), where we are trying to build a Visual Database Management System. I am also a Graduate Teaching Assistant here for CS4400 - Intro to Database Systems. Prior to starting my Masters, I have worked in Machine Learning roles at [Iron Mountain Insight](https://www.ironmountain.com/services/content-service-platform) and [Samsung Research Institute Bangalore](https://research.samsung.com/sri-b). I graduated from [NIT-Trichy](https://www.nitt.edu/home/academics/departments/cse/) in 2018, where I received my B.Tech. in Computer Science and Engineering. Please head over to my [resume](/resume) or [projects](/projects) to know more about my work experiences.

## Interests

<small> I love Mathematics and solving challenging problem statements or puzzles. I always hope and strive to write clean, well-documented code. During my 3 years of industry experience, I have worked with a good mix of Machine Learning, Systems, Cloud and IoT. In the next few years of my career, I want to explore and learn more along similar domains, building solutions that bridge research and industry.  </small>

<small> Work apart, I passionately follow and play Football/Cricket. I try to practice yoga regularly and truly believe being active and fit is essential for a well-functioning mind. </small>

## Get in Touch

<small> If you're taking up CS4400, and you wish to contact me for queries (pun intended! :P), you can find details of my office hours on Piazza. For everything else, please feel free to shoot an email! </small>
