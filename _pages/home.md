## About

<small> Hello there! I currently work with [Iron Mountain Insight](https://www.ironmountain.com/services/content-service-platform) as a Machine Learning Engineer. I previously worked with [Samsung Research](https://research.samsung.com/sri-b) in the IoT Products and Platforms division. I completed my undergraduate study in [Computer Science at NIT-Trichy](https://www.nitt.edu/home/academics/departments/cse/). Please head over to my [resume](/resume) or [projects](/projects) to know more about my work experiences. </small>

<small> I love Mathematics and solving challenging problem statements or puzzles. I always hope and strive to write clean, well-documented code. Some of my recent technical interests include sports insights, document understanding with both textual and visual cues, learning with weak or minimum supervision for vision models, uncertainty modelling in AI. </small>

<small> Work apart, I play/follow Cricket and Football with a lot of passion. I regularly practice yoga and truly believe being active and fit is essential for a well-functioning mind. </small>

<small> Please feel free to drop in a message for anything. </small>
