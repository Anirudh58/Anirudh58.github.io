## About

<small> I am currently a software engineer at Instagram, building and scaling product experiences around IG stories. I earned my MS in Computer Science, with a specialization in ML, from [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/) in 2023, where I also held teaching assistant positions for the ML and DBMS courses. With over 4 years of experience in engineering roles, I have built strong foundations in ML, Cloud, and Systems work. Before that, I graduated from [NIT-Trichy](https://www.nitt.edu/) in 2018, where I did my B.Tech. in Computer Science. Please head over to my [resume](/resume) to know more about my experiences, and feel free to ping me directly through email/linkedin to get in touch!

<!-- <small> This summer I interned at [Meta](https://meta.com) in the Creation ML team, where I had the opportunity to work end-to-end on ML pipelines, building and training large scale models for Music Recommendation used across Facebook for Stories and Reels. Prior to starting my Masters, I have worked in Machine Learning roles at [Iron Mountain Insight](https://www.ironmountain.com/services/content-service-platform) and [Samsung Research Institute Bangalore](https://research.samsung.com/sri-b). I graduated from [NIT-Trichy](https://www.nitt.edu/home/academics/departments/cse/) in 2018, where I received my B.Tech. in Computer Science and Engineering.

## Interests

<small> I love Mathematics and solving challenging problem statements or puzzles. I always hope and strive to write clean, well-documented code. In the past 4 years of my academic and industry experience, I have worked with a good mix of Machine Learning, Systems and Cloud. In the next few years of my career, I want to explore and learn more along similar domains, building solutions that bridge research and industry.  </small>

<small> Work apart, I passionately follow and play Football/Cricket. I try to practice yoga regularly and truly believe being active and fit is essential for a well-functioning mind. </small> -->
