<small> Hello there! I am an MS in Computer Science student at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/), where I will be specializing in Computational Perception and Robotics. I have previously worked in Machine Learning roles at [Iron Mountain Insight](https://www.ironmountain.com/services/content-service-platform) and [Samsung Research Institute Bangalore](https://research.samsung.com/sri-b). I completed my Bachelor's in [Computer Science at NIT-Trichy](https://www.nitt.edu/home/academics/departments/cse/). Please head over to my [resume](/resume) or [projects](/projects) to know more about my work experiences.  </small>

<small> I love Mathematics and solving challenging problem statements or puzzles. I always hope and strive to write clean, well-documented code. Work apart, I religiously play and follow both Cricket and Football. I regularly try to practice yoga and truly believe being active and fit is essential for a well-functioning mind. Please feel free to drop in a message for anything.</small>
